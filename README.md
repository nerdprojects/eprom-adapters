# EPROM Adapters

## SST39SF040 to M27C4001

This is an adapter PCB that can be used to make the "Microchip SST39SF040" pin-compatible with the M27C4001 EPROM.

An alternative to this adapter could be the "Winbond W27E040" chip, which is pin-compatible with the M27C4001.

I used it for patching ROMs in my pinball machines:
